It's a temperature forecasting problem:

Until now, the only sequence data we have covered has been text data, for instance the IMDB dataset and the Reuters dataset. But sequence data is found in many 
more problems than just language processing. In all of our examples in this section, we will be playing with a weather timeseries dataset recorded at the Weather 
Station at the Max-Planck-Institute for Biogeochemistry in Jena, Germany: http://www.bgc-jena.mpg.de/wetter/.

In this dataset, fourteen different quantities (such air temperature, atmospheric pressure, humidity, wind direction, etc.) are recorded every ten minutes, over 
several years. The original data goes back to 2003, but we limit ourselves to data from 2009-2016. This dataset is perfect for learning to work with numerical 
timeseries. We will use it to build a model that takes as input some data from the recent past (a few days worth of data points) and predicts the air temperature 
24 hours in the future.
